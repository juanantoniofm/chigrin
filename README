Chigrin - A software installation and deployment management tool

Introduction
------------

Chigrin is a tool to simplify the installation and deployment of
sofware in remote servers.

Right now, it is in an early stage of development, so there is not
much to look at.

Software Requirements
---------------------

We are using the following libraries and runtime versions:
  * Python 2.7.2
  * Python-nose 1.0.0 <http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/>
  * Pymox 0.5.3 <http://code.google.com/p/pymox/>
  * Fabric 1.2.1 <http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.2.1>

Chigrin will probably work with older versions of those packages, but
we've not tried it yet.

Happy hacking!
